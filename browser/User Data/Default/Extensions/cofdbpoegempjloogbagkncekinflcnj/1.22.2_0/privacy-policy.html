    <h1>Privacy Policy DeepL</h1>
    <p>
      Posted: September 2023 
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains which information and data DeepL SE, Maarweg 165, 50825 Cologne/Germany (“DeepL”) as provider of this extension collects and processes when you use the DeepL Firefox extension, why we do that and how we handle it.
    </p>
    <h2>I.	Translating and improving texts with DeepL Firefox extension</h2>
    <p>
      When you use the DeepL Firefox extension to translate texts you read or write or use DeepL’s writing assistance, DeepL processes these texts in order to provide the translation or improved texts. When using a DeepL Pro subscription to translate or improve texts, these texts will not be permanently stored and not used to improve the quality of our services. When using the DeepL Firefox extension without a DeepL Pro subscription, the texts are processed for a limited period of time to train and improve our neural networks and translation algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, using DeepL Pro for the translation or improvement of texts containing personal data is only permitted if a data processing agreement has been concluded (see section 8.1.3 of DeepL <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-license" target="_blank">Pro Terms and Conditions</a>). When using the DeepL Firefox extension without a DeepL Pro subscription, it is permitted to translate or improve texts containing personal data. For further information, please refer to section 3 and 4 of DeepL’s <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. 
    </p>
    <h2>II.	Login with your DeepL Pro account or DeepL account</h2>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to create an account to be able to use the DeepL Firefox extension. However, if you have created a DeepL account or signed up for a DeepL Pro subscription via the DeepL website deepl.com, it is possible to also log into your account within the Firefox extension and in this way enjoy the associated benefits and safeguards when using the extension. When logging in, DeepL processes your email address and password. In addition, we check whether you have a DeepL account or a paid DeepL Pro subscription in order to provide you with the features under your plan. You can find more information on the processing of your personal data when signing up for DeepL account/DeepL Pro, in section 6 of DeepL’s <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. 
    </p>
    <h2>III.	Technical, device and usage data</h2>
    <p>
      DeepL processes technical and device data to make sure DeepL products and services are running properly, to adapt the services to your needs and to prevent fraud. This data include the domain names you visit from (not the URL, just the domain), your user agent and operating system, name, version and language of the browser as well as the store the extension was installed from. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We also process data about how you interact with our services, this includes data such as when you log in or out, change settings, turn DeepL on our off and use specific features such as our dictionary. If you do not want this, please refrain from installing or uninstall the DeepL Firefox extension. 
    </p>
    <h2>IV.	Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      When using the DeepL Firefox extension, DeepL does not set cookies, but local storage objects in your browser, e.g. user preferences such as user language, target language, which features you enable or disable, domains and languages you blacklisted. 
    </p>
    <h2>V.	Rights, contact and further information</h2>
    <p>
      You have certain rights in case DeepL processes your personal data in context of this extension, including the right to access, correct, or delete certain information. For a detailed description of your rights and how we protect and use your personal data when you use DeepL services in general, please see the DeepL <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. There you can also find more information on DeepL’s data protection officer and his contact details.
